# Power--BI-Covid-19-Weather

## Overview
This project involves creating a COVID-19 and Weather dashboard using Power BI. The data for COVID-19 statistics is obtained from Worldometer, and it is integrated into Power BI to create informative visualizations. Additionally, weather data can be sourced from various APIs and integrated into the dashboard for a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact on weather patterns.

## Features
Data collection from external sources (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
Data transformation and integration in Power BI.
Creation of interactive dashboards with COVID-19 statistics.
Integration of weather data for contextual insights.

## Getting Started
Open Power BI and load the COVID-19 data from Worldometer.

Create visualizations and reports based on the collected COVID-19 data.

Optionally, you can integrate weather data from various weather APIs to provide weather-related context to the COVID-19 statistics. Explore and use Power BI's data transformation capabilities to merge the data sources.

Design an interactive dashboard that combines COVID-19 statistics and weather data

## Usage
This project serves as a valuable resource for organizations or individuals interested in monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on weather patterns and vice versa. You can customize the Power BI reports and dashboards to fit specific geographic areas or regions of interest.
